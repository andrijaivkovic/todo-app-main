## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass SCSS syntax
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Beautiful DND](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd)

### What I learned

By building this challenge is learned more about how React works, especially the useEffect hook.
I also learned how to implement React Beautiful DND to create lists with draggable elements.

### Continued development

In the future I'd like to get more comfortable using React to build apps, but this challenge was a good way to practice what I already know and push myself further.
